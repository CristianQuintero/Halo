--[[ ###  Gun-Game/Arms Race v5 'UP'  ###]]--
--[[ ###  by HÂ® Shaft for Phasor v2   ###]]--

-- GUN GAME: Based on the Counter Strike game called 'Gun Game.' Also, derivatives known as 'Global Offensive' & 'Arsenal: Arms Race' by Valve
-- UP VERSION: Work your way up from weakest to strongest weapons.  Link: http://pastebin.com/NerBUTVk
-- DOWN VERSION: Work your way down from strongest to weakest weapons. Link: http://pastebin.com/9FFkFhZi
-- Compatible with CTF & Slayer gametypes only! Pre-fabricated gametypes for both PC and CE: http://www.mediafire.com/download/2jtch51nba7cmcs/gungame_gametypes.zip

-- GAME PLAY:
-- Each time you kill with a weapon, you will be given a new weapon. (oddball and flag: excluded weapons)
-- The first person to kill with each weapon in the game - wins!
-- There are 10 weapons. You can only use the weapon you are given. All weapons have infinite ammo.
-- When you kill another player, you will only advance if you survive the kill.  If you die during the kill, you don't advance.
-- Melee is instant kill and will advance your level.
-- If you are on level 10 (final level), and get killed by another player, betray or suicide, you are demoted one level.
-- Beserk Mode: When reaching level 10, you activate 'Beserk Mode' which temporarily speeds up all other players and heals the injured.
-- Your player speed is based on your weapon: With a strong weapon, you move slower than you will with a weaker weapon.

--[[ SERVER SETUP - USAGE:
Compatible with CTF & Slayer gametypes only - 'Standard' PC & CE Maps and custom maps with classic weapon sets. Not compatible with race, oddball or koth gametypes, or custom named weapons CE maps.
Gametype should set weapons to normal/generic, infinite nades off.
Place in your cg/scripts/persistent folder.  Intended to be used as a persisitent script, but not required.
DO NOT combine with other death message/player kill scripts during this game.
Use of server rcon commands sv_map_reset and sv_script_reload are allowed, and function well with no errors.  Reloading will behave similar to resetting.
Extended game logging best used for tournaments/scrims/ or debugging.  If you choose to customize this script, set logging to true to help you.
This script has been rigorously tested and believed to be error free. If you get errors, try running the script by itself, it could conflict with other scripts. Set logging to true on lines 29 and 98 to help you debug then read the logs
If help is needed, message me on phasor.proboards.com, or on www.HaloRace.org, or xfire: nervebooger2012
Thank you, I hope you enjoy this as much as we have on our PC and CE servers.
