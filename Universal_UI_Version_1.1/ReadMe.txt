Welcome to the Universal UI.
Why universal? Well, the idea behind this project is to bring together the best of all elements. Whether it be loading popular singleplayer maps without DevMode or discovering new and upcoming creations, this UI serves to better bring together the Halo Custom Edition community.

Want to play the classic campaign? CMT levels? Project Lumoria? A ton of community Singleplayer levels and Firefight maps? You're covered! Also, you get to select the difficulty of any map that you load with the touch of a button. Plus, the multiplayer server list has been modernized and all interface elements have been slimmed down for easy navigation and quick game starting.

Stay updated! The Universal UI also gets periodic updates to accomodate new releases and features.

So what are you wating for? Download the Universal UI today, and start playing Halo CE like never before!
